Hello! Welcome to my homepage! 

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy (MPIfR) working with the MeerKAT radio telescope.

Previously, I worked at ASTRON as a Telescope Scientist working with the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR). For my PhD, I studied the non-thermal emission and magnetic fields in nearby galaxies using the LOFAR and the Westerbork radio telescopes. You can find the electronic copy of my thesis [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/c4ww1wita24wygp/sarrvesh_thesis.pdf?dl=0).

You can access my list of publications on [NASA ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/6ZDS97LGRia7DXFDG0HVPw).
