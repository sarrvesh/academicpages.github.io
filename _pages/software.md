+ **cuda Fast Faraday Synthesis (cuFFS)** - As part of my PhD, I wrote a GPU-accelerated code to carry out rotation measure synthesis. The code is publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/sar
rvesh/cuFFS) and has been published [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A%26C....25..205S/abstract).
+ **LOFAR Unified Calculator for Imaging (LUCI)** - I developed and maintain a suite of calculator web applications for LOFAR ([link](https://support.astron.nl/luci/)). The web app was developed using [Python Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/) and the source code is available on [GitHub](<https://github.com/lofar-astron/LOFAR-calculator). 
+ **LOFAR Imaging Cookbook** - I am the current editor of the [LOFAR Imaging Cookbook](https://support.astron.nl/LOFARImagingCookbook/).
